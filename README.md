<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About This Repository

This repository was created to document the work done in the Generative AI session under Module-3. It consists of multiple assignments. Each assignment has a markdown file which includes the chat with AI and an ipynb file which contains the code generated at the end of each session.

### Assignment_1

Solved a computational thinking question using Gemini. I've solved the idli problem. The problem statement is: You are the benevolent ruler of Dosapuri, and today you're distributing idlis. Your subjects are in a line, and some of them already have some idlis in their hands. You must distribute as few idlis as possible according to the following rules:

1. Every time you give an idli to someone, you must also give an idli to the person immediately behind them. After all the idlis are distributed, each person must have an even number of idlis.
2. Given the number of idlis already held by each citizen, find the minimum number of idlis you must distribute to satisfy the two rules above. If this is not possible, return -1.

The solution is in the Assignment_1 folder along with the chat.

### Assignment_4

With the help of Generative AI, I understood Markov Chain and its use in automatic sentence generation. Also, built a code which generates sentences given a start word and the length of the sentence.
The chat is in the Assignment_4 folder.
